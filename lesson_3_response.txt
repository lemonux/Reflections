When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am using other computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Cos I don't want to save the wrong file

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Don't know forks. Clones is for copying files and branches for experimental changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can check who do the last revision

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Saving at desktop is much easier but with difficulty on remembering what changes are made

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    For experimenting other possibilities / functions.
